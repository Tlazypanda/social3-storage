# Social3 Storage

This project demonstrates one of the IPFS/Filecoin based usecases for our project Social3. Here we are storing a record of Web2 certificates that you are provided on the completion of your courses on udemy/coursera etc. These are then uploaded on to IPFS and we have defined a verified flag for each certificate to maintain whether these certificates are verified for the web3 world. 

## More about Social3

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT:

There is a huge talent gap in Web3 that needs to be bridged. Although there are many solutions available, most of them are simple job boards or riddled with multiple inefficacies. Most importantly, since the web3 talent is relatively new, these platforms fail to have a vetting process to evaluate candidates based on their web3 based skills. Apart from this, they fail to leverage one of the essential tools in hiring - referrals. Web3 is notoriously famous to rely on referrals and close on candidates and skip the line.

Also, Since these platforms are just job boards, the recruiters are left with the hassle of going through a lot of email noise to filter out suitable candidates. The candidates also face the brunt of maintaining multiple applications over email threads and lack a single universal updated profile to showcase to recruiters.

ABOUT SOCIAL3 IN SHORT:

Social3 is the first-ever Web3 based social hiring platform that incorporates a refer-&-earn model but for talent. With Social3, degens can hop onto the website and refer talent by locking in a fixed amount of tokens to earn a percentage of the recruiting fee on successful conversions. Social3 also maintains your social Proof-of-work by verifying NFTs achieved through different Web3 EdTech based startups such as Buildspace, Questbook, Layer3 and many others. Thus helping recruiters vet through talent with just a click.
